# Corpus Bootstrapping Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process of bootstrapping our corpus using a few seed sentences. The goal is to create a self-consistent and expandable knowledge base using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Seed Sentences

We start with a small set of seed sentences that serve as the foundation for our corpus. These sentences should be:

1. Factual and unambiguous
2. Diverse in topic to allow for expansion
3. Interconnected to promote consistency

Example seed sentences:
- "The Earth orbits the Sun."
- "Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen."
- "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy."

## Bootstrapping Steps

1. **Seed Sentence Expansion**
   - For each seed sentence, use the LLM to generate 3-5 related facts or explanations.
   - Ensure these expansions are consistent with the original seed sentence.

2. **Cross-Referencing**
   - Use the LLM to identify potential connections between different expanded sets.
   - Generate bridging sentences that link these concepts together.

3. **Consistency Check**
   - Run all generated content through the LLM to check for logical consistency.
   - Resolve any contradictions or ambiguities.

4. **Knowledge Graph Creation**
   - Create a simple knowledge graph representing the relationships between concepts.
   - Use this graph to identify areas for further expansion.

5. **Iterative Expansion**
   - Select nodes from the knowledge graph for further expansion.
   - Repeat steps 1-4 for these new focus areas.

6. **Validation**
   - Periodically validate the entire corpus for internal consistency.
   - Use external sources to fact-check key statements.

## LLM Prompting Strategies

- Use clear, specific prompts that encourage factual responses.
- Include instructions for maintaining consistency with existing information.
- Implement a system of "roles" for the LLM (e.g., generator, fact-checker, connector) to diversify the generated content.

## Quality Control

- Implement a scoring system for generated content based on relevance, consistency, and novelty.
- Regularly review and curate the corpus to maintain high quality.
- Consider human expert review for critical or complex areas of knowledge.

## Expansion and Refinement

As the corpus grows:
- Identify emerging themes or domains for focused expansion.
- Develop more sophisticated relationships between concepts.
- Consider creating sub-corpora for specialized topics.

By following this process, we aim to create a robust, self-consistent, and expandable corpus that can serve as a foundation for various NLP tasks and knowledge-based applications.
