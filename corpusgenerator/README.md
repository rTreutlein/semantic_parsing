# LLM-Bootstrapped Corpus Generator

## Project Overview

This project aims to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and bootstrap a small, self-consistent corpus of text, and then build upon it. The goal is to create a coherent and expandable knowledge base that can be used for various natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art LLMs to generate initial corpus
- Ensures self-consistency within the generated text
- Provides mechanisms to expand and build upon the initial corpus
- Implements validation and quality control measures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3, GPT-4)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-bootstrapped-corpus.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure your LLM API credentials in `config.py`
2. Run the corpus generation script:
   ```
   python generate_corpus.py
   ```
3. Validate and analyze the generated corpus:
   ```
   python analyze_corpus.py
   ```
4. Expand the corpus using the build script:
   ```
   python build_corpus.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `generate_corpus.py`: Initial corpus generation using LLM
