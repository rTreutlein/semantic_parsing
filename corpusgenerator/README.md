# LLM-Bootstrapped Corpus Generator

## Project Overview

This project aims to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and bootstrap a small, self-consistent corpus of text, and then build upon it. The goal is to create a coherent and expandable knowledge base that can be used for various natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a corpus of logical rules
- Ensures self-consistency within the generated rules
- Provides mechanisms to expand and build upon the initial set of rules
- Implements a knowledge graph structure to represent relationships between rules
- Supports multiple relationship types: specializes, generalizes, complements, negates, and rephrase

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3, GPT-4)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-bootstrapped-corpus.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure your LLM API credentials (implementation details may vary)
2. Use the CorpusGenerator class to generate and expand the corpus:
   ```python
   from corpus_generator import CorpusGenerator
   
   llm_client = YourLLMClient()  # Replace with your actual LLM client
   generator = CorpusGenerator(llm_client)
   sentences, graph = generator.bootstrap_corpus("Coffee wakes people up.", iterations=2)
   ```

## Project Structure

- `corpus_generator.py`: Main class for generating and expanding the corpus of logical rules
- `corpus_bootstrapping.md`: Detailed process for bootstrapping the corpus from seed sentences
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project
