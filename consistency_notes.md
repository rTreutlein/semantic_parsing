# Consistency Issues in PLN Translations

## Spelling Fixes Needed
- "RecivesHelp" should be "ReceivesHelp" in homework helping statements

## Temporal Relationship Patterns
- Currently mixing unary predicates (Sometimes/Always/Recently) with binary relations (AtTime/When)
- Consider standardizing approach for temporal expressions
- Document when to use each if both patterns are kept

## Activity Patterns
- Good pattern: ProvidesHelp/ReceivesHelp shows both sides of interaction
- Consider applying similar bidirectional pattern to other multi-participant activities
- Example: PlayTogether could be more explicit about participants' roles

## Location Relationships
- Multiple predicates: In/LiveIn/LiveOn
- Need clear rules for when to use each
- Consider if all are necessary or if some could be combined

## To Be Investigated
- Continue analyzing for more consistency issues
- Look for patterns in how quantities are expressed
- Check consistency of emotional/mental state representations
- Review handling of possessives
